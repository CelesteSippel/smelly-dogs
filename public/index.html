            <h2>Pug</h2>
              <p> Pugs are known for their gassiness and bad breath.
                They also have lots of wrinkles that need to be cleaned 
                often to lessen their odor.</p>

            <h3> Bulldog </h3>
              <p> The bulldog is known for poor teeth alignment which can lead to large amounts of plaque and tooth decay.
                Bulldogs also have tons of wrinkles that get smelly 
                without proper care.

                <h4> Basset Hound </h4>
              <p> Basset Hounds have long ears that are prone to infection which leads to a lot of foul odor.
              Plus those long ears rub on the ground and pick up all the 
              smells from the ground. </p>
